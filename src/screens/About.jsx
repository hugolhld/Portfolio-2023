              Hi, my name's <span className='font-bold'>Hugo</span>, and I'm a <span className='font-bold'>junior front-end developer</span> who also does back-end work, but with less depth.
              I'm at ease with a lot of frameworks as you can see in the <a href="#skills" className='font-bold underline'>Skills</a> section and many others, I'm curious with a thirst for learning,
              discovering new skills and working methods! That's why I'll be happy to help you with any kind of project, to broaden my skills and give your project a boost. I've taken several training courses,
              including the Grand Ã©cole at HETIC, Bruno Simon's ThreeJS Journey ...
            </p>
